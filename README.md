# TrussDesign
Designs ideal truss to support a given load

The goals of this are as follows:
  -  Implement a simultaneous equation solver (Guassian elimination has been chosen)
  -  Build a truss, and evaluate solution with solver.
  -  Build a genetic algorithm which can design the optimal truss.
